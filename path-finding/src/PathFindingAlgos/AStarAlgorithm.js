/*A* Search Algorithm

Uses a min heap to compare fCosts/hCosts to find the next cell
to check.

A cell is considered closed/visited once its neighbours have been checked.

Always finds a shortest path.

@param {boolean} canCrossDiagonals - whether the path should be able to cross diagonals
@returns {Array} path - The path or null if no path is found
