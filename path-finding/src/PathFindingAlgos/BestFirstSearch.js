/* Best First Search Algorithm

Uses a min heap that compares hCosts to find the next cell to check.

A cell is considered closed/visited once its neighbours have been checked.

Because BFS is a greedy algorithm it only finds the locally optimal solution 
each time when picking the next cell to travel too. This means it does not always find the shortest path.

Due to BFS only checking the heuristic cost it will attempt to move straight to the end node without
taking account a better alternate path due to obstructions. This is shown when unlike the other algorithms
BFS does not recalculate a new distance through the current cell.

@param {boolean} canCrossDiagonals - whether the path should be able to cross diagonals
@returns {Array} path - The path or null if no path is found
